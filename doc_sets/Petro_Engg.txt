Petroleum Engineering

1. INTRODUCTION
Petroleum Engineering focuses on the exploration, extraction, production, and management of oil and natural gas resources.
It combines geology, chemistry, and engineering principles to maximize recovery from reservoirs efficiently and safely.

2. HISTORY & EVOLUTION

Ancient Era: Early oil collection from surface seeps and simple pits.

19th Century: First commercial drilling in the U.S. (1859) and development of petroleum refining.

20th Century: Offshore drilling, enhanced oil recovery, and pipeline networks emerged.

21st Century: Digital oilfields, automation, and renewable energy integration are shaping the industry.

3. MAJOR SUBFIELDS

Reservoir Engineering: Estimating reserves and designing extraction methods.

Drilling Engineering: Planning and executing drilling operations.

Production Engineering: Managing well performance and fluid flow.

Petrophysics: Evaluating rock and fluid properties in reservoirs.

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR): Techniques to increase extraction efficiency.
