Environmental engineering is a professional engineering discipline related to environmental science. It encompasses broad scientific topics like chemistry, biology, ecology, geology, hydraulics, hydrology, microbiology, and mathematics to create solutions that will protect and also improve the health of living organisms and improve the quality of the environment.[1][2] Environmental engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering and chemical engineering. While on the part of civil engineering, the Environmental Engineering is focused mainly on Sanitary Engineering.[3]

Environmental engineering applies scientific and engineering principles to improve and maintain the environment to protect human health, protect nature's beneficial ecosystems, and improve environmental-related enhancement of the quality of human life.[1] Environmental engineers devise solutions for wastewater management, water and air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, and public health.[2][4] They design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems,[5][6] and design plans to prevent waterborne diseases and improve sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. They evaluate hazardous-waste management systems to evaluate the severity of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. They implement environmental engineering law, as in assessing the environmental impact of proposed construction projects.

INTRODUCTION

Environmental Engineering is the branch of engineering that focuses on protecting the environment, public health, and natural resources.
It involves designing systems and technologies to manage waste, control pollution, treat water and air, and ensure sustainable development.

Core Objective: To provide solutions that minimize environmental impact and promote sustainable use of natural resources.

HISTORY & EVOLUTION

Ancient Era: Early sanitation systems and aqueducts.
19th Century: Industrial Revolution created pollution challenges, leading to water and waste management studies.
20th Century: Environmental regulations, air and water treatment technologies, and waste recycling emerged.
1970s–Present: Focus on sustainability, climate change, renewable energy, and environmental policies.
