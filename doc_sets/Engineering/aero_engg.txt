1. INTRODUCTION

Aerospace Engineering (also known as Aeronautical Engineering) is the study, design, and development of aircraft and spacecraft.
It applies physics, mathematics, and materials science to flight vehicles within and beyond the Earth’s atmosphere.

It includes research, design, testing, production, and maintenance of systems like airplanes, helicopters, rockets, drones, and satellites.

Branches:

1. Aeronautical Engineering – focuses on flight within Earth’s atmosphere (airplanes, drones).
2. Astronautical Engineering – focuses on space vehicles (rockets, satellites, spacecraft).

Core Objective:
To make air and space travel safer, faster, more efficient, and sustainable.

2. HISTORY & EVOLUTION

 1903: Wright Brothers achieve first powered flight.
 1914–1918: WWI boosts aircraft technology for defense.
 1930s–40s: Jet engine revolution begins.
 1957: Launch of Sputnik 1 marks the start of space exploration.
 1969: Apollo 11 lands humans on the Moon.
2000s–Present: Focus shifts to reusable rockets (SpaceX), AI in flight systems, and green aviation.
