Shading is used to show light and dark in drawings.

It helps objects look three-dimensional.

Light always comes from a direction.

The side facing the light is bright.

The side away from the light is dark.

The darkest part is called the shadow.

Shading makes drawings realistic.

Artists use pencils for shading.

The HB pencil is good for basic shading.

2B pencils make softer, darker lines.

4B pencils make even darker shades.

6B pencils are very dark and smooth.

Hard pencils give light shades.

Soft pencils give dark shades.

Every pencil has its own effect.

Shading needs slow hand movement.

The lighter you press, the lighter the shade.

The harder you press, the darker the shade.

Smooth shading looks neat.

Rough shading gives texture.

Always hold your pencil at an angle.

Do not hold the pencil upright for shading.

Artists commonly shade using “values”.

Value means how dark or light something is.

Good shading uses many values.

Shading starts with the lightest tone.

Then medium tone is added.

Then the darkest tone is added last.

Smooth gradients look professional.

A gradient is a slow change from light to dark.

Shading shows the surface of an object.

Some surfaces are smooth.

Some surfaces are rough.

Some surfaces are shiny.

Each surface needs a different shading style.

Smooth objects need smooth shading.

Rough objects need textured shading.

Shiny objects need sharp highlights.

Highlights are bright white areas.

You must leave highlights blank.

Never press too hard in highlight areas.

Artists use erasers to create highlights.

A kneaded eraser is good for small highlights.

Cotton can be used to blend shading.

Tissue paper blends softly.

Blending makes shading even.

Do not blend too much.

Over-blending removes texture.

Blending stumps are tools for shading.

They give smooth blending.

Cross-hatching is a shading technique.

It uses criss-cross lines.

Cross-hatching gives depth.

It is used in pen drawings.

Hatching uses lines in one direction.

Lines placed close together look dark.

Lines placed far apart look light.

This technique helps control value.

Stippling uses dots for shading.

Many dots together look darker.

Few dots look lighter.

Stippling takes more time.

It is great for texture.

Scrumbling uses scribbles.

It gives a rough, textured look.

It is used for hair, grass, and fur.

Flat shading is simple.

It uses one shade everywhere.

It looks graphic and clean.

Gradient shading is realistic.

It slowly transitions from light to dark.

It is used for round objects.

Sphere shading starts with light tone.

Then medium tone is added.

Then dark tone is added on one side.

Cast shadow is the shadow on the ground.

It shows where the light is coming from.

Strong light makes sharp shadows.

Soft light makes blurry shadows.

Shading depends on the light source.

The light can be from left.

Or from right.

Or from above.

Or from below.

Or from behind.

The light direction changes shading.

Artists study light to shade well.

Practice improves shading.

Consistent pencil pressure is important.

Sketch lightly first.

Add darker tones later.

Keep your hand steady.

Do not rush shading.

Move the pencil slowly.

Use side of the pencil.

This gives wide, soft shading.

Use the tip for details.

Shadow edges show clarity.

Hard edges show strong shadows.

Soft edges show soft shadows.

Contrast is important.

Contrast means difference between light and dark.

High contrast looks dramatic.

Low contrast looks soft.

Artists decide contrast based on mood.

Reflective light appears on dark areas.

It is a faint light from surroundings.

It adds realism.

Reflective light should be light, not too bright.

Background shading adds depth.

White backgrounds can look flat.

Light shaded backgrounds look better.

Backgrounds highlight the main object.

Graphite smudges easily.

Keep paper clean.

Put a paper under your hand.

Avoid touching shaded areas.

Use fixative spray to protect your work.

Fixative prevents smudging.

Practice shading basic shapes.

Start with sphere.

Then cube.

Then cylinder.

Then cone.

Each shape has different shading logic.

Sphere has smooth gradient.

Cube has sharp edges.

Cylinder has curved gradient.

Cone has a mix of both.

Shading clothes helps wrinkles show.

Wrinkles have dark and light parts.

Shadows show folds.

Highlights show raised areas.

Study real clothes to practice.

Hair shading uses layers.

Start with base shading.

Add darker strands.

Add highlights last.

Do not shade hair as one block.

Fur shading uses small strokes.

Shade in hair direction.

Avoid long lines for fur.

Tree bark shading shows rough texture.

Use random lines for bark.

Rock shading uses rough strokes.

Use dark tones under cracks.

Still life shading improves fundamentals.

Observe real objects carefully.

Study shadows on tables.

Shadows fall opposite the light.

Soft pencils are good for shadows.

Hard pencils are good for details.

Use multiple pencils for best results.

Mechanical pencils are good for fine shading.

They give sharp, thin lines.

Wooden pencils give variety.

Sharpen pencils often.

Dull pencils give rough shading.

Smooth paper gives smooth shading.

Rough paper gives textured shading.

Try different papers.

Learn how each behaves.

Draw slowly at first.

Increase speed as you improve.

Use references always.

Study how shadows fall in nature.

Look at light on your hand.

Observe shadows on walls.

Practice shading a ball daily.

Practice shading a cube weekly.

Try shading from multiple light directions.

Try dramatic lighting.

Try soft lighting.

Avoid over-darkening your drawing.

Keep mid tones balanced.

Do not shade everything dark.

Leave some white spaces.

This gives breathing room.

Work from light to dark.

Do not start dark.

Add layers slowly.

Layering gives good control.

Evaluate your drawing from a distance.

Check if shading looks even.

Fix areas that look patchy.

Avoid random dark spots.

Blend only when needed.

Do not blend if texture is required.

Practice line control.

Practice dot control.

Practice pressure control.

Try shading with different grips.

Study shading of other artists.

Try copying simple shading exercises.

Do not be afraid to erase.

Erasing creates highlights.

Take breaks while shading.

Fresh eyes spot mistakes.

Keep improving daily.

Shading is a skill—practice makes you perfect.
