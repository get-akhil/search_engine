Civil engineers typically possess an academic degree in civil engineering. The length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a bachelor of technology, or a bachelor of engineering. The curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, project management, design and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move on to specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualifications, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.

INTRODUCTION

Civil Engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure such as buildings, bridges, roads, dams, and water systems.
It applies principles of physics, mathematics, materials science, and geology to create safe, functional, and sustainable structures.

Core Objective: To plan, design, and build infrastructure that meets societal needs while ensuring safety, durability, and sustainability.

HISTORY & EVOLUTION

Ancient Era: Construction of pyramids, aqueducts, and roads by civilizations like Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks.
18th–19th Century: Industrial Revolution led to modern bridges, railways, and canals.
20th Century: Skyscrapers, dams, highways, and urban planning became widespread.
Present: Focus on sustainable infrastructure, smart cities, earthquake-resistant structures, and green construction.
